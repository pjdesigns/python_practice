# Variable and Types


# String
name = 'phillip'
# Number (Integer)
age= 32
print(name, age)

balance = 35000

print(f"Hello your name is {name} and you are {age} old")


# Calculating BMI

height = 1.79
weight = 68.7

#Another way to write this code is bmi = weight / height **2
bmi = weight / (height * height)
    
print(bmi)


# Discovering Types
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
